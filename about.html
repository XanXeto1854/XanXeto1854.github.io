        <h1 class="about-title">About Me</h1>
        <div class="about-content">
          <p>My name is Bryce Deets, a 27 year old who has always had dreams in doing some kind of work with technology. Ever since I went to ITT Technical Institute (before they got into legal trouble and shut down), and got into the computer coding and website development classes, I had found a true passion for writing code and seeing the results.</p>
          <p>Now I have recently found a mobile app called Mimo that is currently helping me in furthering my basic knowledge on coding and creating webpages and websites. Does the app work? Well just to let those who are reading this know; I created this entire website by code, every page, from everything you can read to everything you can see. I am confident that this app works as intended.</p>
          <p>If you like how this website turned out like I have, please give a follow to any of my social media outlets that can be found at the bottom of the page! Have a wonderful day!</p>
